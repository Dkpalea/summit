Summit
An Interactive Fiction by Dustin Palea
Release 1 / Serial number 210514 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Basecamp
Plaza Argentina Base Camp (4200m) for Mt. Aconcagua. The trail up to the summit begins here. It's a dangerous, but non-technical climb. There is a collection of ragtag temporary structures that form the Guardia's seasonal presence at the less popular Polish Route base camp. Brightly colored tents dot the plateau. The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

--- Down here, each action requires 1 energy point. And without energy, your health will decrease 11 points per action. ---

You can see 'Basecamp Chest' (closed) here.

Try taking things once you're wearing a backpack. You can hold a lot more that way, but remember, the higher up you go the less you'll be able to carry.

Plaza Argentina Base Camp (4200m). Plaza Argentina is a collection of ragtag temporary structures that form the Guardia's seasonal presence at the less popular Polish Route base camp. Brightly colored tents dot the plateau. The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

You can see Chest1 (empty) here.

Try taking things once you're wearing a backpack. You can hold a lot more that way, but remember, the higher up you go the less you'll be able to carry.

Camp1
Camp 1 (4900m)  At 16,076 feet above sea level, Camp 1 is higher than most people have every climbed. It is higher than any peak in North America. It is just 1000 feet lower than Everest Base Camp in Nepal. Camp 1 is located at the top of the trail on a plateau. Aconcagua is not visible from here, but its sister, Mt. Ameguino's snowy peak looms above you. The camp is located several hundred meters from the glacial stream. There is no outhouse (you must bury your waste, away from any area that could contaminate the stream). Carrying water from the stream to boil for hydration and cooking is required. You can only carry part of what you need to Camp 1 on your first trip, so you must plan carefully. Climbers stay one night in Camp 1, then return to Base Camp for more supplies. You have to bring the bare essentials - tent, sleeping bag, camp stove, food. You don't immediately need ice climbing equipment - mountaineering boots, crampons, ice ax, harness, helmet, rope. But you will eventually need to bring up to Camp 1, as it's needed at higher elevations.

Camp 2 (5850m) Camp 2 is located at the base of visible portions of the Polish Glacier. Below, it retreats under the moraine, but above you, it appears as a both a wall and a river of blue-green ice and white pillars. These are Los Penitentes, statues in ice guarding the glacier. From here, you can see all the way to the Valle de Vacas.

Below, it retreats under the moraine, but above you, it appears as a both a wall and a river of blue-green ice and white pillars. These are Los Penitentes, statues in ice guarding the glacier. From here, you can see all the way to the Valle de Vacas. Just like with portages from Plaza Argentina to Camp 1, you must make several trips over 3 days from Camp 1 to Camp 2 to haul the rest of your gear. You leave almost nothing behind at Camp 1, except for an emergency shelter tent and some provisions. You have the option of stashing extra water and saving some of your favorite food for the descent.

--- At this altitude, each action requires 5 energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease 15 points per action. ---

Plaza Argentina Base Camp (4200m). Plaza Argentina is a collection of ragtag temporary structures that form the Guardia's seasonal presence at the less popular Polish Route base camp. Brightly colored tents dot the plateau. The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

--- Here, each action requires 1 energy point. And without energy, your health will decrease 11 points per action. ---

You can see 'Basecamp Chest' (in which are a match, a sleepsack (empty) and an orange) here.

The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

--- Here, each action requires 1 energy point. And without energy, your health will decrease 11 points per action. ---

The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

--- Here, each action requires 15 energy point. And without energy, your health will decrease 11 points per action. ---

Camp1
Camp 1 (4900m)  At 16,076 feet above sea level, Camp 1 is higher than most people have every climbed. It is higher than any peak in North America. It is just 1000 feet lower than Everest Base Camp in Nepal. Camp 1 is located at the top of the trail on a plateau. Aconcagua is not visible from here, but its sister, Mt. Ameguino's snowy peak looms above you. The camp is located several hundred meters from the glacial stream. There is no outhouse (you must bury your waste, away from any area that could contaminate the stream). Carrying water from the stream to boil for hydration and cooking is required. You can only carry part of what you need to Camp 1 on your first trip, so you must plan carefully. Climbers stay one night in Camp 1, then return to Base Camp for more supplies. You have to bring the bare essentials - tent, sleeping bag, camp stove, food. You don't immediately need ice climbing equipment - mountaineering boots, crampons, ice ax, harness, helmet, rope. But you will eventually need to bring up to Camp 1, as it's needed at higher elevations.

--- Here, each action requires 2 energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease 12 points per action. ---

Camp2
Camp 2 (5850m) Camp 2 is located at the base of visible portions of the Polish Glacier. Below, it retreats under the moraine, but above you, it appears as a both a wall and a river of blue-green ice and white pillars. These are Los Penitentes, statues in ice guarding the glacier. From here, you can see all the way to the Valle de Vacas. Just like with portages from Plaza Argentina to Camp 1, you must make several trips over 3 days from Camp 1 to Camp 2 to haul the rest of your gear. You leave almost nothing behind at Camp 1, except for an emergency shelter tent and some provisions. You have the option of stashing extra water and saving some of your favorite food for the descent.

Camp3
Camp 3 (400m elevation gain). No one stays in Camp 3 for long. It is above the "kill zone" where lack of oxygen and hypoxia can cause rapid deterioration in your mental and physical state. If you decide to use Camp 3, it's only for a quick stop over so you can be up well before sunrise to attempt the summit. You take only the bare essentials: shelter, food, safety equipment, and your climbing gear. You leave your tent and sleeping bag behind, but you won't be staying at Camp 3 after the summit. You will stop to retrieve your equipment, if you survive the summit, but that's it. If you choose to summit from Camp 3, you will have less climbing to do, but you will also be weaker from the extra time at altitude.

Summit (6962m). The summit of Aconcagua is unremarkable in some ways. It's a rocky outcropping with various markers, cairns and flags placed there by other climbers. You pause, but not for too long, for photographs and to congratulate members of your team for the accomplishment. You know that you are on the highest peak anywhere except for the Himalayas. Now, you must descend before the weather turns or you lose your mind from lack of oxygen.

Camp1
Camp 1 (4900m)  At 16,076 feet above sea level, Camp 1 is higher than most people have every climbed. It is higher than any peak in North America. It is just 1000 feet lower than Everest Base Camp in Nepal. Camp 1 is located at the top of the trail on a plateau. Aconcagua is not visible from here, but its sister, Mt. Ameguino's snowy peak looms above you. The camp is located several hundred meters from the glacial stream. There is no outhouse (you must bury your waste, away from any area that could contaminate the stream). Carrying water from the stream to boil for hydration and cooking is required. You can only carry part of what you need to Camp 1 on your first trip, so you must plan carefully. Climbers stay one night in Camp 1, then return to Base Camp for more supplies. You have to bring the bare essentials - tent, sleeping bag, camp stove, food. You don't immediately need ice climbing equipment - mountaineering boots, crampons, ice ax, harness, helmet, rope. But you will eventually need to bring up to Camp 1, as it's needed at higher elevations.

--- Here, each action requires 2 energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease 12 points per action. ---

Basecamp
Plaza Argentina Base Camp (4200m) for Mt. Aconcagua. The trail up to the summit begins here. It's a dangerous, but non-technical climb. There is a collection of ragtag temporary structures that form the Guardia's seasonal presence at the less popular Polish Route base camp. Brightly colored tents dot the plateau. The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

Camp2
Camp 2 (5850m) Camp 2 is located at the base of visible portions of the Polish Glacier. Below, it retreats under the moraine, but above you, it appears as a both a wall and a river of blue-green ice and white pillars. These are Los Penitentes, statues in ice guarding the glacier. From here, you can see all the way to the Valle de Vacas. Just like with portages from Plaza Argentina to Camp 1, you must make several trips over 3 days from Camp 1 to Camp 2 to haul the rest of your gear. You leave almost nothing behind at Camp 1, except for an emergency shelter tent and some provisions. You have the option of stashing extra water and saving some of your favorite food for the descent.

Camp3
Camp 3 (400m elevation gain). No one stays in Camp 3 for long. It is above the "kill zone" where lack of oxygen and hypoxia can cause rapid deterioration in your mental and physical state. If you decide to use Camp 3, it's only for a quick stop over so you can be up well before sunrise to attempt the summit. You take only the bare essentials: shelter, food, safety equipment, and your climbing gear. You leave your tent and sleeping bag behind, but you won't be staying at Camp 3 after the summit. You will stop to retrieve your equipment, if you survive the summit, but that's it. If you choose to summit from Camp 3, you will have less climbing to do, but you will also be weaker from the extra time at altitude.

You can only carry part of what you need to Camp 1 on your first trip, so you must plan carefully. Climbers stay one night in Camp 1, then return to Base Camp for more supplies. You have to bring the bare essentials - tent, sleeping bag, camp stove, food. You don't immediately need ice climbing equipment - mountaineering boots, crampons, ice ax, harness, helmet, rope. But you will eventually need to bring up to Camp 1, as it's needed at higher elevations.

Camp1
Camp 1 (4900m)  At 16,076 feet above sea level, Camp 1 is higher than most people have every climbed. It is higher than any peak in North America.

Camp2
Camp 2 (5850m) Camp 2 is located at the base of visible portions of the Polish Glacier. Below, it retreats under the moraine, but above you, it appears as a both a wall and a river of blue-green ice and white pillars. These are Los Penitentes, statues in ice guarding the glacier. From here, you can see all the way to the Valle de Vacas. Just like with portages from Plaza Argentina to Camp 1, you must make several trips over 3 days from Camp 1 to Camp 2 to haul the rest of your gear. You leave almost nothing behind at Camp 1, except for an emergency shelter tent and some provisions. You have the option of stashing extra water and saving some of your favorite food for the descent.

There is no outhouse (you must bury your waste, away from any area that could contaminate the stream). Carrying water from the stream to boil for hydration and cooking is required. You can only carry part of what you need to Camp 1 on your first trip, so you must plan carefully. Climbers stay one night in Camp 1, then return to Base Camp for more supplies. You have to bring the bare essentials - tent, sleeping bag, camp stove, food. You don't immediately need ice climbing equipment - mountaineering boots, crampons, ice ax, harness, helmet, rope. But you will eventually need to bring up to Camp 1, as it's needed at higher elevations.

Camp1
Camp 1 (4900m)  At 16,076 feet above sea level, Camp 1 is higher than most people have every climbed. It is higher than any peak in North America. It is just 1000 feet lower than Everest Base Camp in Nepal. Camp 1 is located at the top of the trail on a plateau. Aconcagua is not visible from here, but its sister, Mt. Ameguino's snowy peak looms above you. The camp is located several hundred meters from the glacial stream. There is no outhouse (you must bury your waste, away from any area that could contaminate the stream). Carrying water from the stream to boil for hydration and cooking is required. You can only carry part of what you need to Camp 1 on your first trip, so you must plan carefully. Climbers stay one night in Camp 1, then return to Base Camp for more supplies. You have to bring the bare essentials - tent, sleeping bag, camp stove, food. You don't immediately need ice climbing equipment - mountaineering boots, crampons, ice ax, harness, helmet, rope. But you will eventually need to bring up to Camp 1, as it's needed at higher elevations.

--- Here, each action requires 2 energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease 12 points per action. ---

Basecamp
Plaza Argentina Base Camp (4200m) for Mt. Aconcagua. The trail up to the summit begins here. It's a dangerous, but non-technical climb. There is a collection of ragtag temporary structures that form the Guardia's seasonal presence at the less popular Polish Route base camp. Brightly colored tents dot the plateau. The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

You can see 'Basecamp Chest' (closed) here.
