[----- locations -----]

Basecamp is a room.
The energyDecline of Basecamp is 1.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Basecamp is 11.
The description of Basecamp is "Plaza Argentina Base Camp (4200m) for Mt. Aconcagua. The trail up to the summit begins here. It's a dangerous, but non-technical climb. There is a collection of ragtag temporary structures that form the Guardiaâ€™s seasonal presence at the less popular Polish Route base camp. Brightly colored tents dot the plateau. The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

--- Here, each action requires [the energyDecline of Basecamp] energy point. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Basecamp] points per action. ---".
South of Basecamp is nowhere.

Camp1 is a room.
The energyDecline of Camp1 is 2.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp1 is 12.
Camp1 can be seen from Basecamp.
The description of Camp1 is "Camp 1 (4900m)  At 16,076 feet above sea level, Camp 1 is higher than most people have every climbed. It is higher than any peak in North America. It is just 1000 feet lower than Everest Base Camp in Nepal. Camp 1 is located at the top of the trail on a plateau. Aconcagua is not visible from here, but its sister, Mt. Ameguinoâ€™s snowy peak looms above you. The camp is located several hundred meters from the glacial stream. There is no outhouse (you must bury your waste, away from any area that could contaminate the stream). Carrying water from the stream to boil for hydration and cooking is required. You can only carry part of what you need to Camp 1 on your first trip, so you must plan carefully. Climbers stay one night in Camp 1, then return to Base Camp for more supplies. You have to bring the bare essentials - tent, sleeping bag, camp stove, food. You donâ€™t immediately need ice climbing equipment - mountaineering boots, crampons, ice ax, harness, helmet, rope. But you will eventually need to bring up to Camp 1, as itâ€™s needed at higher elevations. 

--- Here, each action requires [the energyDecline of Camp1] energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp1] points per action. ---".
Camp1 is north of Basecamp.

[glacier obstacle]

Camp2 is a room.
The energyDecline of Camp2 is 5.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp2 is 15.
The description of Camp2 is "Camp 2 (5850m) Camp 2 is located at the base of visible portions of the Polish Glacier. Below, it retreats under the moraine, but above you, it appears as a both a wall and a river of blue-green ice and white pillars. These are Los Penitentes, statues in ice guarding the glacier. From here, you can see all the way to the Valle de Vacas. Just like with portages from Plaza Argentina to Camp 1, you must make several trips over 3 days from Camp 1 to Camp 2 to haul the rest of your gear. You leave almost nothing behind at Camp 1, except for an emergency shelter tent and some provisions. You have the option of stashing extra water and saving some of your favorite food for the descent. 

--- Here, each action requires [the energyDecline of Camp2] energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp2] points per action. ---".
Camp2 is north of Camp1.

Camp3 is a room.
The energyDecline of Camp3 is 10.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp3 is 20.
The description of Camp3 is "Camp 3 (400m elevation gain). No one stays in Camp 3 for long. It is above the 'kill zone' where lack of oxygen and hypoxia can cause rapid deterioration in your mental and physical state. If you decide to use Camp 3, itâ€™s only for a quick stop over so you can be up well before sunrise to attempt the summit. You take only the bare essentials: shelter, food, safety equipment, and your climbing gear. You leave your tent and sleeping bag behind, but you wonâ€™t be staying at Camp 3 after the summit. You will stop to retrieve your equipment, if you survive the summit, but thatâ€™s it. If you choose to summit from Camp 3, you will have less climbing to do, but you will also be weaker from the extra time at altitude. 

--- Here, each action requires [the energyDecline of Camp3] energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp3] points per action. ---".
Camp3 is north of Camp2.

Summit is a room.
The energyDecline of Summit is 10.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Summit is 20.
The description of Summit is "Summit (6962m). The summit of Aconcagua is unremarkable in some ways. Itâ€™s a rocky outcropping with various markers, cairns and flags placed there by other climbers. You pause, but not for too long, for photographs and to congratulate members of your team for the accomplishment. You know that you are on the highest peak anywhere except for the Himalayas. Now, you must descend before the weather turns or you lose your mind from lack of oxygen. 

--- Here, each action requires [the energyDecline of Summit] energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Summit] points per action. ---".
Summit is north of Camp3.
North of Summit is nowhere.
