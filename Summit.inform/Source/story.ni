Basecamp is a room.
The energyDecline of Basecamp is 1.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Basecamp is 11.
The maxLoad of Basecamp is 100.
The description of Basecamp is "Plaza Argentina Base Camp (4200m) for Mt. Aconcagua. The trail up to the summit begins here. It's a dangerous, but non-technical climb. There is a collection of ragtag temporary structures that form the Guardiaâ€™s seasonal presence at the less popular Polish Route base camp. Brightly colored tents dot the plateau. The Polish Glacier looms in the distance, and a swift stream - the headwaters of the Vacas river flow from its base. There is an outhouse on the edge of camp. The weekly helicopter retrieval of the 50 gallon drum of waste is a highlight and one of the only things that marks civilized time.

Use your map to help you decide what supplies you should take on your ascent.

--- Down here, each action requires [the energyDecline of Basecamp] energy point. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Basecamp] points per action. ---".
South of Basecamp is nowhere.

Camp1 is a room.
The energyDecline of Camp1 is 2.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp1 is 12.
The maxLoad of Camp1 is 100.
The description of Camp1 is "Camp 1 (4900m)  At 16,076 feet above sea level, Camp 1 is higher than most people have every climbed. It is higher than any peak in North America. It is just 1000 feet lower than Everest Base Camp in Nepal. Camp 1 is located at the top of the trail on a plateau. Aconcagua is not visible from here, but its sister, Mt. Ameguinoâ€™s snowy peak looms above you. The camp is located several hundred meters from the glacial stream. There is no outhouse (you must bury your waste, away from any area that could contaminate the stream).

--- Here, each action requires [the energyDecline of Camp1] energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp1] points per action. ---".
Camp1 is north of Basecamp.

The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp2 is 15.
The maxLoad of Camp2 is 75.
The description of Camp2 is "Camp 2 (5850m) Camp 2 is located just above most of the Polish Glacier. Below, it appears as a both a wall and a river of blue-green ice and white pillars. These are Los Penitentes, statues in ice guarding the glacier. From here, you can see all the way to the Valle de Vacas. Up here it's noticeably colder and much windier, but still manageable.

--- At this altitude, each action requires [the energyDecline of Camp2] energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp2] points per action. ---".
Camp2 is north of Camp1.

Camp3 is a room.
The energyDecline of Camp3 is 10.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp3 is 20.
The maxLoad of Camp3 is 40.
The description of Camp3 is "Camp 3 (400m elevation gain). No one stays in Camp 3 for long. It is above the 'kill zone' where lack of oxygen and hypoxia can cause rapid deterioration in your mental and physical state. If you decide to use Camp 3, itâ€™s only for a quick stop over so you can be fueled to attempt the summit. You usually only take the bare essentials: a source of energy and warmth. If you survive the summit, you will only stop back here to retrieve your equipment â€“ but that's a BIG if. 

--- Way up here, each action requires [the energyDecline of Camp3] energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Camp3] points per action. ---".
Camp3 is north of Camp2.

Summit is a room.
The energyDecline of Summit is 10.
The healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Summit is 20.
The maxLoad of Summit is 15.
The description of Summit is "Summit (6962m). The summit of Aconcagua is unremarkable in some ways. Itâ€™s a rocky outcropping with various markers, cairns and flags placed there by other climbers. You pause, but not for too long, for photographs and to congratulate members of your team for the accomplishment. You know that you are on the highest peak anywhere except for the Himalayas. Now, you must descend before the weather turns or you lose your mind from lack of oxygen. 

--- At the top, each action requires [the energyDecline of Summit] energy points. And without energy, your health will decrease [the healthDeclineWithNoEnergy of Summit] points per action. ---".
Summit is north of Camp3.
